Looking above, it looks like two main clusters exist, which likely correspond to the broad categories. Depending on the depth of the dendrogram plotted, you can see how subclusters are being formed within each main cluster. Each cluster is formed according to the height of the dendrogram (see y axis), cutting at different places produces different number of clusters. "

One thing to note however is that each document belongs to a broad class of categories, but there are more specific categories within each of the broad ones. Algorithms exist (such as hierarchical clustering) which can effectively look for clusters within clusters. "
